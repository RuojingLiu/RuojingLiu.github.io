## Chicago Real Estate Projection

Chicago's real estate market has been slowly but steadily recovering since the last economic crisis. According to the Home Value Index calculated by Zillow, Chicago's home value experienced a sharp drop starting from November 2007. During the next few years, it plunged from its peak of around $247K to the bottom of just $166K in April 2012.

As the market struggled a few months around that low point, home value in Chicago started on a trajectory of growth from October 2012. After running a regression, I found that the r^2 value of the linear trendline is above 0.9, making the trendline, to some extend, trustworthy.

The speed of the bounce-back is quite slow for Chicago compared with the national level. As many data shows, the real estate market has almost, if not already, recovered to its original level before the economic crisis took place. However, for Chicago, from an intercept of $168K, if the current rate continues as it did for the past few years, Chicago's home value will only be fully recovered in January 2019. As forecast for December 2018 shows a value of $246K, and only for January 2019 does the forcast reveals a number larger than $247K -- the peak value before the fallout.
